# 🐍 Python Assignment

This repository contains two Python programs demonstrating basic concepts of Python programming such as user input, string formatting, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements.

# Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations

## Description
This program takes two integers as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Operations Performed
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Special Condition
If the second number is zero, the program prevents division and displays:
"Division by zero is not allowed"

## Concepts Used
- Type casting using `int()`
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- User input handling
